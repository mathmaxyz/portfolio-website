        <p className="text-sm max-w-xl mb-6 font-bold">I am a software engineer with three years experience. I am currently looking for work after 2 years at Universal Music Group as a full stack developer. I worked with Java, Spring, Angular, Ionic and AWS in that role. My biggest acheivement was completing an ionic app rewrite and new identity provider integration in half the time estimated by the senior frontend engineer on my team, therefore doubling productivity. I'm hoping to keep stacking up sucesses like that in my next role, and to learn some new technologies.
